In this same GitHub repository, create a new branch ‘geometry-calculator’, we'll work on a simple Python program that calculates the area of a circle and the area of a rectangle. We'll use Git stash to switch between working on multiple features (calculating circle area and calculating rectangle area) without committing incomplete changes.

Workflow Steps:

a. Create a New Branch:
- Create a new branch named "feature/circle-area" to work on the circle area feature

b. Stash Changes for Circle Area Feature:
- Before committing the changes, stash them using git stash to save the incomplete feature implementation.

- Verify that the working directory is clean

- Retrieve the stashed changes

- Complete the circle area feature implementation and save the changes.

c. Commit and Push Circle Area Feature:
