In this same GitHub repository, create a new branch ‘geometry-calculator’, we'll work on a simple Python program that calculates the area of a circle and the area of a rectangle. We'll use Git stash to switch between working on multiple features (calculating circle area and calculating rectangle area) without committing incomplete changes.

Workflow Steps:

a. Create a New Branch:
- Create a new branch named "feature/circle-area" to work on the circle area feature

b. Stash Changes for Circle Area Feature:
- Before committing the changes, stash them using git stash to save the incomplete feature implementation.

- Verify that the working directory is clean

c. Create a New Branch for Rectangle Area Feature:
- Create a new branch named "feature/rectangle-area" to work on the rectangle area

d. Stash Changes for Rectangle Area Feature:
- Before committing the changes, stash them using git stash to save the incomplete feature implementation.

- Verify that the working directory is clean

e. Switch Back to Circle Area Branch:

- Switch back to the "feature/circle-area" branch to continue working on the circle area feature.

- Retrieve the stashed changes

- Complete the circle area feature implementation and save the changes.

f. Commit and Push Circle Area Feature:

g. Switch Back to Rectangle Area Branch:

- Switch back to the "feature/rectangle-area" branch to continue working on the rectangle area feature.

- Retrieve the stashed changes

- Complete the rectangle area feature implementation and save the changes. 

h. Commit and Push Rectangle Area Feature

i. Create Pull Requests:

- Create a pull request to the ‘dev’ branch.

j. Review and Merge

- Have another team member or reviewer review your pull requests. - After receiving approval, merge both pull requests into the main branch.
